                <p style="text-align: left">
                    This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Dolf Tech Inc. ("Apor app") collects, uses,
                    maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of its www.apor.com.gh Site
                    and any derivative or affiliated Sites on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the "Site").
                    Please note that this Privacy Policy covers Apors’ practices regarding information collected from its Site.
                </p>
                <h5 style="text-align: left">The Information Apor Collects</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Like most website operators, Apor collects non- personally-identifying information of the sort that
                    web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                    site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
                    information is to better understand how our visitors use our Site. Additionally, certain visitors to Varsity
                    Tutors' Site choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally- identifying
                    information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction.
                    Those who engage in transactions with us online — by purchasing our in- app packages are asked to provide
                    additional information, such as the personal and financial information required to process those
                    transactions. Apor also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                    (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, however, and do not disclose
                    such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying
                    information, as described below. A User browsing the Site without registering an account or affirmatively
                    providing personally identifiable information to Apor does so anonymously.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Apor may collect personally identifiable information from customers in a variety of ways. Personally
                    identifiable information may include (i) contact data (such as a customer's name, telephone/ mobile number,
                    mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) financial data (such as a customer's credit card number, mobile money
                    number); and (iii) demographic data (such as a customer's grade, age and income). A User may also provide
                    personally identifiable information about others, such as emergency contact information for notification in
                    the event a situation requires it. If you communicate with Apor by e-mail; electronic devices or other
                    interactive devices; complete online forms, surveys; or communicate with Apor by any means, any information
                    provided in such communication may be collected by Apor. Apor may also collect information about how
                    customers use our portal, for example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the pages of
                    the Apor portal, or the domains from which customers originate.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    If you choose to use our referral service to refer a friend about our app, we will ask you for your friend's
                    name and email address or phone number. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or text
                    inviting him or her to download and sign on to the app. Apor stores this information for the sole purpose of
                    sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us
                    <a href="https://tech-yiad.github.io/tech-yiad/AporPrivacyPolicy.html">Apor Privacy Policy</a> to request
                    that we remove this information from our database.

                <h5 style="text-align: left">Information Sharing</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left">
                    It is Apors' policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect through the Site,
                    e-mail, phone, or any other communications we have with you. We treat the confidential information you
                    share with us, such as students' academic performance and any financial information, with the utmost
                    respect. Apor will not disclose student records with third parties under any circumstance, except as
                    specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law. We may, however,
                    share a student's information with the tutor(s) who may or will be providing tutoring to the student
                    so that they may evaluate the engagement and personalize and tailor the tutoring to the student.
                    In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the
                    purpose of the visitor's interaction with Apor. We do not disclose personally-identifying information
                    other than as described below in the section "How Apor Uses Information". Visitors can always refuse to
                    supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain related activities.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Apor may use personally identifiable information collected through the App for the specific purposes
                    for which the information was collected; to contact Users regarding Apor's live-learning platform; to
                    communicate to Users regarding products and services offered through Apor, its parent and trusted affiliates;
                    and otherwise to enhance Users' experience with Apor. We may also use information collected through the App
                    for research regarding the effectiveness of the Application and the business planning, marketing, advertising
                    and sales efforts of Apor, its parent and trusted affiliates.Apor may disclose personally identifiable
                    information collected from Users to its parent and other related companies, trusted affiliates, and business
                    partners who will use the information for the purposes outlined above, as necessary to provide the services
                    offered by or through Apor and to provide the App itself, and for the specific purposes for which the
                    information was collected. These companies are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information
                    in any other way. Apor may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from Users
                    to investors and potential partners. Finally, Apor may disclose or transfer personally identifiable information
                    collected from Users in connection with or in contemplation of a sale of its assets or business or a merger,
                    consolidation, or other reorganization of its business.

                    needed to facilitate tutoring for that student, who may be a minor. Apor is committed to complying fully
